# KINEMATICS OF A 3-DOF ROBOTIC FINGER FOR CAPTURING OBJECT
## Abstract
  This study is interested in simulating the structure of a robotic finger with three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) and the ability to grasp objects in various forms. The design of all robotic fingers will be carried out in a tool that can efficiently simulate and test the structure. Then, the Forward Kinematics will be created for all five fingers on the same structural base to enable accurate finger positioning and movement in three dimensions. In addition, the Inverse Kinematics section is studied to calculate the Joint Position of each finger in detail. In addition, a specific algorithm that controls the grasping of objects in various forms is developed by applying the study of Quintic Trajectory to make the movement smooth and take the same time in each joint.  
## Objectives
1)	To study the creation of robotic fingers and simulate finger movements.
2)	To study a 3-DOF robotic finger system that can grasp spherical and cylindrical objects of various sizes.
3)	To study the relationship between the parameters of different shapes of objects and the position of each finger tip.
4)	To study and apply Quintic Trajectory in finger movement control system.
## Scopes
1)	The movement of a 3-DOF finger system is simulated.
    * Use Quintic Trajectory to pass the position of each joint only to calculate Forward Kinematics.
    * A study was conducted on Inverse Kinematics to calculate the Joint Position of each finger.
    * There is no study on Dynamics.
3)	Scope of 3-DOF Robotic Finger
    * It is a Planar Robot or a robot that moves on a plane.
    * 3-DOF Robotic Finger has 5 fingers in total, which together form one human hand.
4)	There are demonstrations of holding objects and shapes of different sizes, such as cylinders and circles.
5)	Quintic Trajectory is used to control finger movement to make it look natural.
6)	The simulation was performed using the Simscape tool on MATLAB.
